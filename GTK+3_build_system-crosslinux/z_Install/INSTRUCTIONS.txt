 GTK+ Build system (cross-linux) - by Tarnyko <tarnyko@tarnyko.net>
 -------------------------------
 (as for the moment, this build environment only runs of Linux CentOS 6.0.
  It's easily extensible, though)

 (To customize the process, edit the "vars.sh" script and modify :
   DISTRO = your Linux distro (ex : CentOS)
   ARCH = i386/amd64
   NATIVEPREFIX = where the intermediate native stack will be stored
   WIN32PREFIX = where the final win32 stack will be stored)

   First open a terminal and position yourself in this directory.

1) Run "1_Prereq.sh" to install the prerequisites (distro-specific).

2) Run "2_MinGW.sh" to install MinGW (distro-specific).

3) Run "3_PrepBuild.sh" to prepare the build directories & vars.

4) Run "4_Build.sh" to build the stack !

 (PS : Resulting binaries will be in "/opt/gtk3_win32",
       compilation log files in the buildenv, "libs/logs")
